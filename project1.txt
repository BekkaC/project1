            <p>Basically, Semantic elements are clear commands from a developer to the browser. Instead of using commands like div and span -- where the meanings are not clear, semantic elements are more obvious. The commands header, footer and table are all clear to the user and the browser. Semantic elements are also more accessible and make content more searchable. They are also more international and they help other programmers read the structure of your page. </p>
