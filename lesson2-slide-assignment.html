          <h2>Deciding which type of plants suit your lifestyle</h2>
            <p>Different types of plants have different needs. If you're not home enough to really give your plant attention, try a succulent. Want to give it a moderate amount of you time? Snake plant. Do you want a plant that needs you as much as a pet? Try a water lily.</p>
