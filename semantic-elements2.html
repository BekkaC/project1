  <h1>My favorite sitcoms: A semantic webpage</h1><br>
  <h2>90s sitcoms</h2>
  <p>I think <strong>Seinfeld</strong> wins this category for me. I think it was very funny for a <em>show about nothing.</em></p>
  <h3>Early Aughts</h3>
  <p>This is toss up between <q>Parks and Rec</q> and <q>Arrested Development</q>, both very funny in different ways. 30 Rock was good too.</p>
  <h4>2010-now</h4>
  <p><small>The jury is still</small> out for the past 14 years.</p>
